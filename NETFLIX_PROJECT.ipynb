        "This project focuses on analyzing Netflix’s content dataset to derive meaningful insights and apply machine learning techniques for content segmentation. Netflix is one of the leading streaming platforms globally, hosting a vast library of movies and TV shows across multiple genres, languages, and regions. With such a large content repository, understanding content patterns and organizing data efficiently becomes essential for improving user experience and recommendation strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "The primary objective of this project is to explore the Netflix dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and apply unsupervised machine learning techniques to identify hidden patterns and similarities among content. The dataset includes information such as title type, genre, country, release year, duration, and rating. These attributes help analyze trends related to content distribution, production growth over the years, and genre popularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Initially, data cleaning and preprocessing steps were performed to handle missing values, standardize formats, and prepare features suitable for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted using visualizations to understand content distribution by type, release year trends, country-wise production, and genre dominance. These insights help identify how Netflix’s content strategy has evolved over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following EDA, feature engineering techniques were applied to convert categorical and numerical attributes into a suitable format for machine learning models. An unsupervised learning approach using clustering was selected, as the objective was to group similar content without predefined labels. The K-Means clustering algorithm was implemented to segment Netflix content based on selected features. The Elbow Method was used to determine the optimal number of clusters.\n",
        "\n",
        "The clustering results helped identify distinct content groups with similar characteristics, such as genre combinations, duration patterns, and production timelines. These clusters can assist Netflix in content categorization, recommendation improvements, and strategic content planning. Additionally, the insights derived from clustering can support business decisions related to content acquisition and user engagement strategies.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this project demonstrates how data analysis and machine learning can be effectively applied to real-world business problems. By leveraging EDA and unsupervised learning, valuable insights were extracted from Netflix’s content data, showcasing the practical applicability of machine learning techniques in the streaming industry."
